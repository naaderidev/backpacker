## Introduction  
This is an initial demo of a website designed specifically for tour leaders. The website is composed of various sections, which are briefly discussed below: 

- The suggestion section is intended for the audience, so you can get ideas from your audience for future trips.

- A separate section with a pleasant design has been included for upcoming tour programs.

- Most importantly, a section has been considered for registering tours.

- On the other hand, several sections have been placed at the end of the website so that you can share your travel photos, YouTube video links, and stories and adventures from your trips with the audience.

- More details about the stories and adventures can be viewed on the blog page. The audience can also contact you through the contact page. And by subscribing to the newsletter, they can be informed about your latest tours. 

**This is an initial sample of this website, which is written solely with raw JavaScript and CSS, and no backend or database has been considered for the website. In the next version of this project, it will be updated as a full-stack project, using the NextJS framework, Tailwindcss, Mongodb database and useful React libraries.**
